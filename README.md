## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS 

### What I learned

I learned how to make an animated accordion menu animation using JS. After *many* trials and errors, I found (after a brief visit to W3Schools) that the best property to animate was the max-height property. A similar effect can be achieved with other properties such as height, grid-template rows, position, scale, translate etc. But it's not as *smooth* as when using max height.

### Useful resources

- [1](https://medium.com/outsystems-experts/how-to-achieve-60-fps-animations-with-css3-db7b98610108) - This helped me understand which properties can be animated in CSS.
